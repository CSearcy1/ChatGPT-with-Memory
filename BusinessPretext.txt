I retired after more than 20 years as a Career Counselor and have continued my career assisting veterans, military spouses, and their family members find meaningful careers that they can be proud of. There is a mental health epidemic in the military community, and I feel that my efforts, paired with the support of great companies, can help stem the tide of suicides in the veteran community. I want to create business that provides corporations with all of the tools they need to start and run successful military programs, to include DoD SkillBridge, Military Spouse Employment Program, and DoL VETS. The tools include step by step instructions for initiating the programs, contact information for key personnel, and SOPs for use once they get authorization. I will provide monthly training sessions, possibly in a conversational setting with inspirational leaders or subject matter experts on the topic. I want to establish a website based on the Army's Be, Know, Do leadership model that's aimed at companies. Lastly, I want to offer individual consulting services, to include actually establishing the programs for them, as well as individual professional development.

Some key features of the business include:

1. Toolkits: The business will provide step-by-step instructions, contact information for key personnel, and SOPs for corporations to initiate and maintain these programs. These toolkits will serve as a comprehensive guide for companies to navigate the complexities of starting and managing military initiatives.

2. Training Sessions: The business plans to offer monthly training sessions for company employees involved in the military programs. These sessions may take the form of conversational settings with inspirational leaders or subject matter experts, providing valuable insights and best practices in supporting military personnel and their families.

3. Website: The business intends to establish a website based on the Army's Be, Know, Do leadership model. This platform will serve as a centralized hub for companies, providing information, resources, and guidance on creating successful military programs. The website will aim to educate and inspire corporations to actively engage in veteran support initiatives.

4. Individual Consulting Services: Additionally, the business will offer individual consulting services to companies. This may involve hands-on assistance in establishing and implementing military programs, ensuring compliance with regulations, and maximizing the program's effectiveness. 

The business I am proposing is a comprehensive consulting service that assists corporations in creating and maintaining successful military programs. These programs are aimed at supporting veterans, military spouses, and their family members in finding meaningful careers and addressing the mental health challenges prevalent in the military community. 

The business will provide toolkits that serve as step-by-step guides for companies to navigate the complexities of initiating and managing military initiatives. These toolkits will include instructions, contact information for key personnel, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure smooth implementation and adherence to regulations. 

In addition to the toolkits, the business will offer monthly training sessions for company employees involved in the military programs. These training sessions may feature conversational settings with inspirational leaders or subject matter experts who can provide valuable insights and best practices. The aim is to continuously educate and empower companies in their efforts to support military personnel and their families. 

To provide easy access to information and resources, the business will establish a website based on the Army's Be, Know, Do leadership model. This website will be a centralized hub offering guidance, resources, and inspiration for companies looking to create successful military programs. It will serve as a platform to educate and inspire corporations to actively engage in veteran support initiatives. 

Furthermore, the business will offer individual consulting services to companies. Through these consulting services, the business will provide hands-on assistance in establishing and implementing military programs. This may involve navigating regulations, developing tailored strategies, and optimizing the effectiveness of the programs. 

Overall, the business aims to provide corporations with all the necessary tools, support, and expertise to successfully initiate and sustain impactful military programs. By collaborating with great companies, the business hopes to make a tangible difference in addressing the mental health challenges and promoting meaningful careers for veterans and their families.

The Army's Be, Know, Do leadership model can be adapted to corporations to promote effective leadership and create a positive work environment. Here's how each component of the model can be applied:

1. Be: In the corporate context, "Be" refers to personal and organizational values, character, and ethics. It involves setting a strong example as a leader and creating a culture of integrity, respect, and inclusivity within the company. This can be achieved through clear communication of values, fostering ethical decision-making, and promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace.

2. Know: "Know" in a corporate setting refers to knowledge and expertise. Leaders need to continually develop their skills and knowledge to stay relevant in their industry. This can be achieved through ongoing learning opportunities, professional development programs, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Encouraging employees to expand their knowledge and providing access to relevant resources can also contribute to the overall success of the company.

3. Do: In the corporate world, "Do" translates to action and execution. This component focuses on effective leadership, setting goals, and leading by example. It involves taking initiative, making informed decisions, and driving results. Leaders should empower their employees, delegate responsibilities, and create a supportive environment that encourages innovation and accountability.

By adapting the Be, Know, Do model, corporations can foster strong leadership, ethical values, continuous learning, and a culture of action. This can result in improved employee engagement, increased productivity, and the development of a positive work environment that attracts and retains top talent. Incorporating this framework into the company's values and practices can contribute to long-term success and the achievement of organizational goals.
